## üìã Pre-Deployment Testing (Recommended)

### Test 1: Memory Stability Test ‚è≥
**Objective:** Verify memory doesn't accumulate during 2-hour session

**Steps:**
```
1. Open iPad
2. Launch app in Safari
3. Open DevTools (Safari > Develop > Console)
4. Process 10-15 support tickets
5. Leave app idle for 5-10 minutes
6. Process 10-15 more tickets
7. Monitor memory in DevTools
```

**Expected Result:**
- Memory stays between 80-150 MB
- No continuous growth
- Cleanup messages appear in console

**Time Required:** 2 hours
**Pass Criteria:** Memory stable, no out-of-memory errors

---

### Test 2: Battery Drain Test ‚è≥
**Objective:** Verify battery improvement on 8-hour shift

**Steps:**
```
1. Start with iPad at 100% battery
2. Enable Guided Access mode
3. Run app for 8 hours
4. Record battery % at: 0h, 2h, 4h, 6h, 8h
5. Calculate drain rate
```

**Expected Results:**
- Hour 0: 100%
- Hour 2: 92-94%
- Hour 4: 84-88%
- Hour 6: 76-82%
- Hour 8: 68-72%
- **Final: 30-35% remaining**

**Alternative Scenario (with idle periods):**
- App restarts ~1-2 times during 8 hours
- Battery drops to 40-50% remaining

**Pass Criteria:** >30% battery remaining (vs 0% without fix)

---

### Test 3: Auto-Restart Test ‚è≥
**Objective:** Verify app restarts at idle threshold

**Steps:**
```
1. Open app
2. Note the time
3. Don't touch screen for 31 minutes
4. Watch app reload automatically
5. Check console for restart message
```

**Expected Result:**
- App reloads after ~30 minutes
- No errors on reload
- Fresh state (no accumulated data)
- Console shows: "Kiosk idle for 30+ minutes..."

**Time Required:** 35 minutes
**Pass Criteria:** App restarts cleanly, no errors

---

### Test 4: Activity Detection Test ‚è≥
**Objective:** Verify touch input resets idle timer

**Steps:**
```
1. Open app
2. Wait 25 minutes without touching
3. Touch screen once (anywhere)
4. Wait 31 more minutes without touching
5. App should restart after total 56 minutes
```

**Expected Result:**
- Touch resets the 30-minute idle timer
- App doesn't restart at 30min (because of touch)
- App restarts at ~56min mark

**Time Required:** 60 minutes
**Pass Criteria:** Touch properly resets idle timer

---

### Test 5: Guided Access Compatibility Test ‚è≥
**Objective:** Verify features work in Guided Access mode

**Steps:**
```
1. Enable Guided Access on iPad
2. Launch app in Guided Access
3. Test all three flows:
   - Check-In (QR scan + voice)
   - Damage Waiver (voice capture)
   - Leave Message (voice message)
4. Verify features work normally
5. Wait for idle restart in Guided Access
```

**Expected Result:**
- Camera works in Guided Access
- Microphone works in Guided Access
- App restarts normally
- Can't exit due to Guided Access lock

**Pass Criteria:** All features work, app stable in Guided Access

---

### Quick Test (Minimum - 30 minutes)
If time is limited, run this:

**Quick Test Steps:**
```
1. Launch app
2. Process 2-3 support tickets
3. Check DevTools memory (should be <100MB)
4. Wait 31 minutes and watch app restart
5. Verify no errors on restart
```

**Pass Criteria:**
- Memory stable
- App restarts after 30min
- No console errors

---

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Pre-Deployment Check
```bash
# Verify build is ready
[ -d "build" ] && echo "‚úÖ Build folder exists"
```

**Expected:** Build folder exists

### Step 2: Deploy to Firebase (if not already done)
```bash
cd /Users/terryutley/Projects/TechPortal/SupportKiosk
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

**Expected:** Deployment successful, no errors

### Step 3: Clear iPad Cache
On iPad:
```
Settings > Safari > Clear History and Website Data
```

**Purpose:** Force download of latest app version

### Step 4: Test on iPad
```
1. Open Safari
2. Navigate to your kiosk URL
3. Add to Home Screen (if PWA)
4. Launch app
5. Verify it works
```

**Expected:** App launches and functions normally

### Step 5: Monitor for Issues
```
First 24 hours:
- Check console logs
- Verify app auto-restarts at 30min
- Confirm no crashes
- Monitor battery drain
```

## ‚úÖ Post-Deployment Verification

### Within 1 Hour
- [ ] App loads without errors
- [ ] All three flows work
- [ ] No console errors visible

### Within 24 Hours
- [ ] Monitor for any crash reports
- [ ] Verify idle restart happens ~1-2 times
- [ ] Confirm battery improved
- [ ] Check user feedback

### Within 1 Week
- [ ] Analyze battery usage trends
- [ ] Determine if idle timeout adjustment needed
- [ ] Document any issues for support team
- [ ] Create runbook for troubleshooting

---

## üîß Configuration Adjustments

### If App Restarts Too Frequently

**Symptom:** App restarts every 15-20 minutes

**Fix:**
```javascript
// Edit src/App.js around line 157
// Change from:
const thirtyMinutesMs = 30 * 60 * 1000;
// To:
const thirtyMinutesMs = 45 * 60 * 1000;  // 45 minutes
```

**Then deploy:**
```bash
npm run build
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

---

### If Battery Still Drains Too Fast

**Symptom:** Battery drops >10% per hour during idle

**Check:**
1. Verify idle detection is working (watch for 30min restarts)
2. Verify touch listeners are active
3. Check if camera/mic are stuck on

**Fix:**
```javascript
// Reduce idle timeout to trigger more restarts
const idleMs = 20 * 60 * 1000;  // 20 minutes
```

---

### If Memory Still Growing

**Symptom:** Memory grows continuously

**Check:**
1. Open console and watch for cleanup messages
2. Verify cleanup functions are being called
3. Check if app is restarting at idle threshold

**Likely Issue:** Idle timeout not working properly
```bash
# Verify in console:
# Should see: "Kiosk idle for 30+ minutes. Restarting app..."
# at 30-minute mark
```

---

## üö® Rollback Procedures

### Quick Rollback (No Code Changes)

If deployment causes issues:

```bash
# Option 1: Revert to previous build
firebase hosting:channel:deploy previous

# Option 2: Deploy previous version
# (Requires keeping backup of previous build)
```

### Code Rollback

If critical issue found:

```bash
# Undo all changes
git revert HEAD
npm run build
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

### Idle Timeout Emergency Fix

If idle restart is causing problems:

```javascript
// Temporarily disable by increasing timeout to unreachable value
const idleMs = 8 * 60 * 60 * 1000;  // 8 hours (won't restart)
npm run build
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

---

## üìû Support Contacts

### During Deployment
- Monitor console for errors
- Check battery usage trends
- Document any anomalies

### If Issues Found
1. Check troubleshooting section in PRODUCTION_HARDENING_QUICK_REFERENCE.md
2. Review console logs (Safari > Develop > Console)
