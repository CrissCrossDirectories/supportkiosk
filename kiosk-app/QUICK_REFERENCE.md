## ⚡ Pro Tips

1. **Microphone Muted?** Look for red dot near front camera. Toggle mute switch if visible.

2. **WiFi Issues?** Use 5GHz if available. Better for audio uploads.

3. **Battery?** Enable Low Power Mode in Settings if battery is concern.

4. **Close Other Apps** Before using kiosk. Frees up RAM for camera/audio.

5. **Write Down Passcode** - Store securely, not on iPad!
